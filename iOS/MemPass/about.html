 MemPass is a simple password creation and retrieval system. It works by running an irreversible hash algorithm on a string of characters. The string of characters or phrase is what you type to get your password. This phrase is injected with a seed that is unique to your device. Guaranteeing your passwords won't be the same as some one else using the same phrase. You can regenerate your key at any time at the seed screen.</p>


<p> MemPass does not store any of your generated passwords and is a serverless technology. That is what is great about the simplicity of MemPass. It is up to your memory to retrieve your password. I recommend using a simple easy to remember phrase that is unique to each service you use. For example I would use apple15 for www.apple.com. </p>
